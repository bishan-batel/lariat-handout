\subsection{Constructors and Destructor}


\subsubsection{Constructor}
\indent This constructor is really simple. You don't need to do any logic, just
use a member initializer list to initialize

\subsubsection{Copy Constructor (own-type)}
\indent This is the standard copy constructor. The function should loop through the
instance passed in, pushing each element of the other onto the back of
the one being constructed.

\indent It should be done using the algorithm for (or directly calling) \cpp{push_back}
so that all of the nodes are split correctly.

\subsubsection{Copy Constructor (template)}
\indent This copy constructor is algorithmically identical to the own-type
constructor, but is templated to allow for a Lariat type instantiation
with different parameters for \cpp{<T>} and \cpp{<Size>}.

\indent Refer to the above guide to templates for details on how to write the
function signature.

\subsubsection{Destructor}
The destructor is a simple, generic destructor. It's sole purpose is to
free all the nodes in the linked list so there are no memory leaks.
