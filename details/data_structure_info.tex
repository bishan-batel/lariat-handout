\subsection{Data Structure Information}

\subsubsection{\cpp{find}}
Walk the list in a similar fashion to that detailed in the \cpp{findElement}
helper function (\ref{section:rec_helper}), but check equivalence for each element in each node,
returning the index when the desired element is found.

If the desired element is not found, return the total number of elements
contained in the data structure.

\subsubsection{\cpp{size}}
You should be tracking the \cpp{size_} member variable throughout the element
addition and removal processes. Return that variable now.
