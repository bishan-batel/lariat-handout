\subsection{Assignment Operators}

\subsubsection{\cpp{operator=} (own-type)}
\indent This assignment operator generally works exactly the same as you might
expect. Set the non-pointer members as necessary, clear this instance's
data, then walk through the right-hand argument's list adding each
element to this instance

\subsubsection{\cpp{operator=} (template)}
\indent This assignment operator follows the exact same algorithm as the own-type
version, but is a nested template like I described above.
